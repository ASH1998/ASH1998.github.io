  desc: I am Ashutosh Mishra. I am from Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I am interested in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am a curious bug. I love how the ML is changing the world. I aim at contributing as much as I can to these fields. My research interests include Generative Adversarial Networks, Attention models, Sequence to Sequence models. My current research project is on Deep representation of visual descriptions. Apart from my interests in AI I have a keen interest in Japanese Culture and Space.  # Describe yourself.
